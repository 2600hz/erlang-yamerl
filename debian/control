Description: Pure Erlang YAML 1.2 parser
 YAML is a human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based data
 serialization language designed around the common native data types of
 agile programming languages
 .
 yamerl is a pure Erlang application which is able to parse YAML 1.1
 and YAML 1.2 documents, as well as JSON documents. It only depends on
 standard Erlang/OTP applications, no external dependency is required.
 It doesn't use native code either (neither port drivers nor NIFs).
 .
